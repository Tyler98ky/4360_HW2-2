In this repoI have included the source.v file as well as a PNG showing the working wave for the full carry adder. In the source.v, I have the full carry adder implemented, as well as a register file that creates 4 destination registers, and finally a control module that utilizes these registers in order to determine whether to use the full carry adder for A + B, or to use the full carry adder in the inverse, by calling it such as full-carry-adder(A, comp(b)). This creates the functionality of both A + B and A - B, utilizing the control module to determine witch to use based on the signified bit. However, as I was trying to implement the registers and control modules, I was running into compile-time errors that I was not able to sort out in time. Since I had the project imported into git as well there were also some oddities with formatting everytime I opened the project into modelsim and I couldn't figure out if that was the root cause of the issues or if there were bugs in the code I needed to fix. Either way, the intened functionality of my code had it compiled with the registers and control module is as stated above; depending on a signifying bit, choose whether to normally add the numbers, or add the inverses and utilize the registers in order to help you do so.
